# box2d.dart

This is a Dart port of Java's Box2D libraries.

The Java Box2D library was originally written by Daniel Murphy (status
February 2015).

* bin/bench2d.dart     Contains benchmark uses by Joel Webber
* example/index.html   Contains browser demos as written by Dominic Hamon
* lib/                 Contains port of Daniel Murphy's jbox2d

First Dart port of an earlier version of Box2D library was
done by Dominic Hamon. We are grateful for his work.

This is not an official Google project.
